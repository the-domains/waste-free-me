The organic materials in land fill (food-scraps and food waste) are
huge producers of the polluting gasses formed from land fill. The rotting
scraps release methane gas 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide,
contributing significantly to climate change through additional greenhouse gas
emissions.

We will look at
waste free solutions for all types of households---whether you're in a city
apartment, caravan, farm house, share house or suburban property.

Follow the journey as we go for Zero and make a waste-free lifestyle
easier for everyone to achieve.

**WATCH **- our fortnightly waste weigh-in and detective work of looking
into where your waste and recycling really ends up.

**GET **-- hints and tips as we find the answers to all the trashy questions
we encounter and find all the waste-free life hacks we can!

**DISPEL **- rubbish and recycling myths

**JOIN IN** - "Me? But how? I
don't have time for all that are weighing and measuring of rubbish."

Each month, we will facebook and blog post the items in the 'too hard'
basket and turn to YOU to help us find a genuine use for them. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aa9b1672-ea49-4004-b09f-a128a675dfb5.jpg)

You have little gems of wisdom buried in your brain---notes from Grandma,
talents for seeing a bit of problem rubbish as a useful re-purposed item,
scientific knowledge, common sense or skills to turn waste into wonderful.
